# # Variables
# # - strings, letters, numbers, or any other stuff 
# # you can make with a keyboard
# # a variable is just a fast way to refer to something else
# # variables do not make the program faster.
# # They make the program slower! 
# # Variables make it easier for us to write programs.

# # Data Types
# # - Programming langauges see different types fo variables
# # differently
# # - String - English stuff.
# # - Number - I think you know what this is. Something with numbers (or - or e)
# # # print 3.3e10+"Joe"
# # -- float = it has a . in it
# # -- integer - has no .
# # - Booleans - true or false, on or off, 1 or 0, yes or no, right or left
# # - List - list of things. a single variable with a bunch of parts
# # - Dictionaries - variable of variables
# # - Objects - super dictionaries
